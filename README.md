Practice jquery with cats

Add jQuery to the page so that:

* When the page first loads, all the cats should be hidden.
* When a user clicks a button, the corresponding cat should appear.
* Clicking a different button should hide all except the selected cat.
* Highlight the button to show the currently selected cat.
